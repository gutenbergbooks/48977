<h2><i>Foreword</i></h2>

<p>Compared with the unimaginable richness of his inner
life as the overpowering volume and splendor of his works
reveal it, Bach&rsquo;s day-to-day existence seems almost pedestrian.
It had none of the drama and spectacular conflicts
that marked the careers of men like Mozart, Beethoven,
and Wagner. His travels, far less extensive than those of
his great contemporary, Handel, were confined to areas of a
few hundred miles at most in central and northern Germany
and were undertaken chiefly for sober professional
purposes. The present volume, which advances no claim
whatever to any new or original slant, aims to do no more
than furnish for those who read and run a meager background
of a few isolated highspots in Bach&rsquo;s outward life
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>and a momentary sideglance at a tiny handful of his supreme
creations. Its object will have been more than
accomplished if in any manner it stimulates a radio listener
to deepen his acquaintance with Bach&rsquo;s immeasurable art.</p>

<h2><i>Johann Sebastian Bach</i></h2>

<p>In families of unusual longevity and fruitfulness, observed
Goethe, Nature has a way of bringing forth in her
own good time one figure who unites all the greatest and
most distinctive qualities of his various forebears. The poet
of <cite>Faust</cite> alluded to this mystic process of genealogy with
reference to Voltaire. Actually, he might with quite as
much reason have been speaking of Bach. For Bach combined
and brought into sharpest focus the musical talents
and predilections of almost three antecedent generations,
as well as their physical and moral sturdiness, their spirituality,
their robust clannishness. Yet the miracle of
Johann Sebastian Bach transcends even this amazing
fusion of ancestral traits. It is hardly excessive to look
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
upon him as the consummation and fulfillment of all the
musical trends that went before him and, in a manner of
speaking, the origin of all those that came after.</p>

<p>There is probably nothing in the history of music to
compare with Bach&rsquo;s ancestry from the standpoint of fertility,
complexity, and endurance. There can be no question
of tracing here its multiple ramifications and cross
currents. Enough that we obtain our earliest glimpse of
Sebastian&rsquo;s great-great-great-grandfather as far back as the
latter part of the sixteenth century. The direct line of the
great composer did not die out till 1845. Seven generations
thus stretch between the extremes of this genealogical
phenomenon. The Thuringian countryside around Arnstadt,
Erfurt, Wechmar, Eisenach, and other communities
of the region cradled the different branches of the family.
Two traits, at least, all of them had in common&mdash;their love
of music and their attachment to one another. Some became
organists, some cantors, some town musicians, and
their devotion to their craft was so proverbial that, for
years after, all musicians in the town of Erfurt came to be
known as &ldquo;the Bachs&rdquo; even if totally unrelated. The real
Bachs felt each other&rsquo;s company so indispensable that, if
the members of the family could obviously not all live
in the same place, they made it a point to hold periodic
reunions. After prayers and hymns they spent the day in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
feasting and jolly recreation. One of their favorite amusements
was to extemporize choruses out of popular songs
and these lusty medleys (or, as they called them, &ldquo;quodlibets&rdquo;)
they would bellow for hours on end with great
good humor, while the listeners laughed till their sides
ached.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Son of a Court Musician</span></h3>

<p>Johann Sebastian Bach was born in Eisenach on March
21, 1685, according to the Old Style reckoning, which is
ten days behind the Gregorian calendar. His father, Johann
Ambrosius Bach, had married an Elisabeth L&auml;mmerhirt
nearly twenty years earlier in Erfurt, where he was town
player. Probably he became Court musician to Duke
Johann Georg, at Eisenach, whither he had removed. His
plea to return to Erfurt was disallowed by his noble employer
and so it came that Johann Sebastian saw the light
in Eisenach. Not, however, in the rambling house on the
Frauenplan as traditionally supposed. Comparatively recent
investigation has shown that the actual birthplace is a
short distance away, in a street named after Martin Luther.
A rather unromantic looking dwelling, it was occupied till
just before the Second World War by a barber.</p>

<p>There is a certain symbolic propriety that Bach should
have been born in Eisenach rather than in the more prosaic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Erfurt. Eisenach had powerful religious and romantic associations.
Luther had been entertained by Frau von Cotta
in one of its gabled houses while the Reformer was still
a boy. High above the city towered the Wartburg, where
Luther translated the Bible, threw his inkwell at the Devil,
and composed some of his sturdiest chorales. Up there, too,
had dwelt the saintly Elisabeth, while in its halls knightly
Minnesingers had competed in tourneys of song. In the
remoter distances rose the fabled H&ouml;rselberg, where according
to legend Dame Venus held her unholy court and
ensnared the souls of unwary men. Just what impression
these things made on the child Bach we cannot say. At
any rate he could not remain untouched by the currents of
music. The boy had a pretty treble voice and at the local
school he sang in the so-called Currende choir, making a
few pennies now and then on feasts and holidays, at weddings
and at funerals, in company with his schoolmates.
He may even have sat in the organ loft of St. George&rsquo;s
Church, pulling out the heavy stops for his uncle, Johann
Christoph Bach, who had been the organist there for many
years.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, we have no elaborate record of Johann
Sebastian&rsquo;s boyhood. His father, indeed, taught him the
rudiments of violin and viola, and Terry credits the youngster
with &ldquo;patient concentration&rdquo; in the pursuit of these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
instrumental studies. We do know that he became before
long an uncommonly proficient violinist but took particular
delight in playing viola when he participated in ensemble
work. Like Mozart in after years, the youthful Bach
loved to find himself &ldquo;in the middle of the harmony.&rdquo;</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Early Years at School</span></h3>

<p>At the Eisenach &ldquo;Gymnasium&rdquo; he learned reading and
writing, catechism, Biblical history, and the Psalms. And
when only a little over eight he was fairly immersed in
Latin conjugations and declensions. In Eisenach was laid
the foundation of that learning which distinguished his
whole life, though he never enjoyed the advantage of a
college education such as he afterwards gave his famous
sons. Yet his school attendance at this early stage showed
a good deal of irregularity, due, perhaps, to illness or bereavement.
He was only nine when he lost his mother. In a
short time his father married again but his death terminated
that union scarcely four months later.</p>

<p>The Eisenach household having broken up, Johann Sebastian
was sent in 1695 to the home of his married brother,
Johann Christoph, who lived at Ohrdruf, some thirty miles
away. A pupil of the great Johann Pachelbel, the Ohrdruf
Bach functioned as organist at the Church of St. Michael&rsquo;s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/2_study_weimar.jpg" width="600" height="482" alt="Bach&rsquo;s study in Weimar" />
<p class="center caption">Bach&rsquo;s study in Weimar, where many of his greatest works,
including <cite>The Well-Tempered Clavier</cite>, were composed.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>Johann Christoph, an accomplished musician, lost no time
in giving his young brother his first lessons on the clavier.
Presumably he supplemented them with instruction on
the organ. In any case the boy seems to have had access
to a large quantity of good music. He was an extraordinarily
capable student with a voracious appetite for musical
learning and no sooner had he mastered one difficult
task than he plagued his brother for another more difficult
still.</p>

<p>At this period occurred that celebrated incident for
which Johann Christoph has been very harshly judged by
posterity. A collection of clavier pieces by masters like
Froberger, Kerll, Pachelbel, B&ouml;hm and Buxtehude, lay in
a book case with a latticed front. Johann Sebastian&rsquo;s pleas
to study them met with a stern refusal. So the youngster
resorted to stratagem. By thrusting his hands through the
lattice and rolling up the music he managed to extract it
when his brother&rsquo;s back was turned. Not being allowed a
candle he copied out the various works by moonlight,
a job which occupied him for six months and probably laid
the foundation for those eye troubles which toward the
last were to rob him of his sight. Nor did he enjoy the fruit
of his labors. Johann Christoph found the copy and
promptly confiscated it. Before blaming him, as is usually
done, it may be well to reflect that Bach&rsquo;s brother was not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
necessarily moved by an impulse of cruelty but more probably
felt the need of curbing somewhat an audacious and
immature young genius, who threatened to get out of
hand.</p>

<p>During the five years he spent in Ohrdruf Bach attended
the town school which enjoyed an unusually high reputation
throughout Thuringia. His studies, naturally, ranged
much further afield than at Eisenach and his scholastic
progress appears to have been rapid. His high, clear voice
and instinctive musicianship not only assured him a place
(and rather substantial rewards) in the chorus of the institution
but in proper season gained him the friendly
interest of Elias Herder, a young musician summoned to
replace Johann Arnold, a highly unpopular teacher who
had been dismissed as a &ldquo;pest of the school, a scandal of
the church and a cancer of the community.&rdquo; Through the
good offices of Herder young Bach found an opportunity
to join the select choir (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Mettenchor</i>) of St. Michael&rsquo;s
Church in L&uuml;neburg, more than two hundred miles to the
north.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Student at L&uuml;neburg</span></h3>

<p>The time was ripe, at all events, for Johann Sebastian
to leave Ohrdruf. His brother&rsquo;s family was increasing
apace and the organist&rsquo;s quarters had been growing uncomfortably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
cramped. Furthermore, Bach was now fifteen,
an age at which boys were expected to start earning their
living. So the chance to remove to L&uuml;neburg proved a
stroke of luck.</p>

<p>But there were more fascinating advantages to it than
even the possibilities of bed and board. Easily accessible
were several sources of musical and cultural inspiration. In
L&uuml;neburg itself the Church of St. John had as its organist
none less than Georg B&ouml;hm, one of the outstanding personalities
in German music of the era preceding the full
unfoldment of Bach&rsquo;s grandeur. Thirty miles off lay Hamburg,
which harbored the venerable master of the organ,
Adam Reinken; and the operatic life of that city had burst
into bloom under the leadership of Reinhard Keiser. Up in
the direction of the Danish frontier the town of L&uuml;beck
sheltered still another giant, the organist Dietrich Buxtehude.
Sixty miles in an easterly direction lay Celle, whose
Duke, Georg Wilhelm, had married a beautiful and spirited
French Huguenot, Eleanore Desmier d&rsquo;Olbreuse, and
turned his court into a miniature Versailles, where French
musicians in particular were royally welcomed. Naturally,
a little opera house formed part of this island of Gallic
charm, elegance and culture, enlivened by a continual succession
of ballets, operas, and other musical diversions.
Whether Bach obtained admission to the auditorium or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
whether he was smuggled into the orchestra pit by some
friendly player we do not know. But of one thing we are
certain: his love for the music of the French masters and
his intimate acquaintance with it was in large degree the
result of what he heard and learned at the gracious ducal
court of Celle.</p>

<p>Bach spent almost three years in L&uuml;neburg, where St.
Michael&rsquo;s Church and its conventual buildings were his
home. He continued his studies at the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Partikular Schule</i> of
the church, sang with the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Mettenchor</i> and was a member
of the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Chorus Symphoniacus</i>, of which the choir formed
the nucleus. He developed, gradually, into a capable organist
and came under the healthy influence of Georg
B&ouml;hm at the Church of St. John, whose impress can be
detected in some of Bach&rsquo;s early organ works. B&ouml;hm was a
pupil of Adam Reinken and undoubtedly urged the young
man to hear the aged master, though one can readily imagine
that Bach would sooner or later have sought out
Reinken of his own volition. The summer vacation of 1701
found him traveling afoot to Hamburg. The patriarch had
been organist of St. Katherine&rsquo;s Church half his life and
though now nearly eighty continued to be famous for his
virtuosity and his extraordinary skill in improvisation. Nor
was it his executive powers alone which captured his young
listener. Reinken&rsquo;s compositions fascinated him and their
influence is perceptible in certain of Bach&rsquo;s clavier pieces
twenty years later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>This first trip to Hamburg was by no means Bach&rsquo;s last.
And thereby hangs a tale&mdash;a fish story, if you will, but
nevertheless true and related a number of times by Bach
himself. Tired and hungry on his long jaunt back to L&uuml;neburg,
the boy sat down for a moment&rsquo;s rest outside the
kitchen of an inn whose open windows exhaled tempting
savors. Suddenly there fell at his feet the heads of two
herrings, a fish prized as a great delicacy in his native
Thuringia. Eagerly picking them up he found inside of
each a Danish ducat obviously put there by some kindly
soul who had caught sight of the famished young wanderer.
Whether or not Bach ate the heads, he suddenly
found himself with money enough for an ample dinner and
sufficient also to defray the expenses of another visit to
Hamburg.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Organist at Arnstadt</span></h3>

<p>It may be taken for granted that Bach planned an
eventual journey to L&uuml;beck to hear the mighty Buxtehude.
In any case this trip was deferred. Hard as he had studied
at L&uuml;neburg and greatly as his musical powers had grown,
it was becoming clear that he must put his talents to practical
use. He had been earning a living of a sort with his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
singing and likewise as a violin and viola player. But his
voice had changed and was no longer of great use as a
source of revenue. His powers as an organist, on the other
hand, were expanding prodigiously, a fact which had become
known not only in L&uuml;neburg but far away in his
native Thuringia. He began to long for an organ post of
his own and the steady income it would assure.</p>

<p>Late in 1702 the news spread that a new organ was
being completed at the Church of St. Boniface in Arnstadt,
one of the ancestral seats of the Bach family and rich in
its traditions. Doubtless Arnstadt had its eyes on the promising
disciple of B&ouml;hm and Reinken, young as he was.
Bach, too, felt it wise to watch the situation at close range.
So he returned to Thuringia. The new instrument of St.
Boniface was not ready nor was it completed till the summer
of 1703. Sangerhausen offered a possibility, but that
was thwarted by the machinations of high-placed people
with influence.</p>

<p>Yet by Easter Bach found himself enrolled in the service
of Duke Johann Ernst, brother of the reigning Duke Wilhelm
Ernst of Weimar. His stay in Weimar on this occasion
was brief though it seems to have earned him some
honors, including the useful if misleading title of &ldquo;Princely
Saxon Court Organist.&rdquo; But scarcely three months later he
was back in Arnstadt, where the St. Boniface organ was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
ready for its test. That Bach should have been entrusted
with so responsible a task indicates how high must have
been his reputation already. He examined the instrument,
reported favorably on it and, to demonstrate his satisfaction,
played an inaugural recital which impressed the Consistory
to such a degree that on August 9 he was officially
appointed organist.</p>

<p>It was not long before he was at odds with the authorities.
He had, in addition to his organ playing, the
disagreeable job of training the choristers, a shiftless, good-for-nothing
rabble from the local school who, as the city
council complained, &ldquo;behave in a scandalous manner, resort
to places of ill repute and do other things we shrink
from naming.&rdquo; Bach, for his part, had already developed
that obstinate, uncompromising nature that grew more
violent the older he became and brought him into no end
of difficulties throughout his life. When his mind was fixed
on achieving a certain end nothing would swerve him
from it. He could be as hardheaded and intransigent a
fighter for what he considered his rights and as ruthless
in combating opposition as were Beethoven and Wagner in
later generations.</p>

<p>His extraordinary talents did not prevent him from
attracting a number of enemies which progressively increased.
One of the most bitter of these was a bassoonist
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
named Geyersbach whom Bach on more than one occasion
had to reproach for his musical incompetence. Matters
came to a head when the organist, escorting a lady home
one night, was set upon by the ruffian accompanied by a
brawling rout of students who attempted to cane him. As
tough a fighter as the best of them, Bach took to his sword
when Geyersbach shouted, &ldquo;Hundsfott&rdquo; (&ldquo;Cowardly rascal&rdquo;),
and with a roar of &ldquo;Zippelfagottist&rdquo; laid about him
so furiously that the &ldquo;nanny-goat bassoonist&rdquo; escaped manhandling
only by the prompt help of his cronies. The incident
caused considerable agitation among the townsfolk.</p>

<p>Scarcely had it subsided than Bach upset the Consistory
by requesting a month&rsquo;s leave to make that pilgrimage to
Buxtehude in L&uuml;beck which he had been unable to carry
out at L&uuml;neburg not long before. He secured as a substitute
in his absence a cousin, Johann Ernst, whose efficiency
he guaranteed. Grudgingly the authorities complied, unwilling
to risk an issue with so valuable, if testy, a servant.
While Bach did not make the whole journey of three
hundred miles on foot he undoubtedly walked a fair part
of the way. He timed his trip to arrive in L&uuml;beck for
Buxtehude&rsquo;s famous <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Abendmusicen</i>, at the Marienkirche,
which had been celebrated for a generation and which
were continued under the veteran&rsquo;s successors until the
nineteenth century. These evening musicales, in which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
instrumentalists as well as choristers participated, were
carried out on a scale larger than anything to which the
young organist had been accustomed. One thing this
L&uuml;beck visit did was to give Bach a heightened idea of
music in its relation to public worship, an idea he strove
to carry out for the rest of his life, but realized only fully
when he was at the height of his tremendous powers in
Leipzig.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Inspiration from the Master, Buxtehude</span></h3>

<p>One may be sure that the immense inspiration he received
from Buxtehude was as potent and influenced the
current of his genius as fully as had B&ouml;hm and Reinken a
little earlier. That he exhibited his own powers on the
L&uuml;beck organ and profited by the example and suggestions
of Buxtehude is clear. Forgetting the flight of time and his
obligations in Arnstadt, Bach let the winter months slip by.
It is even possible that he weighed the question of stepping
into the shoes of the seventy-year-old master. But
there was a condition attached to that which made him
hesitate as it had Handel and Mattheson before him.
Whoever wanted Buxtehude&rsquo;s job had to take Buxtehude&rsquo;s
daughter in the bargain. The lady, it appears, was not
especially well favored and she was all of twenty-eight&mdash;scarcely
the most alluring prospect to a young man only
twenty, and one which involved the further possibility of
having to house the father-in-law for as long as the Lord
might choose to spare him!</p>

<p>The year of 1706 had dawned before Bach turned reluctantly
toward Arnstadt once more. He took occasion
to make a few side trips on the way, stopping over at
Hamburg and L&uuml;neburg to greet old associates and
friends. By the end of January he was back in the organ
loft of St. Boniface. His return was not exactly a love feast.
The congregation and Consistory were looking for a
capable, mild-mannered organist, not a disquieting virtuoso.
But in a relatively short period Bach had become
just that. He was plainly above the musical heads of the
townsfolk. There were murmurings of discontent which
were duly brought to his attention. He paid not the slightest
heed, till finally the Consistory proceeded to lay down
the law. The authorities had quite a number of bones to
pick with their refractory young genius. They had given
him a leave of one month, not of four. He answered that he
imagined his substitute was competent to fill his shoes for
the extra time. Far from being placated the worthy elders
then reproached him for accompanying the church hymns
with all sorts of brilliant and audacious improvisations, full
of unexpected harmonies and variations which left the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
congregation groping blindly for the melody. When people
had remonstrated that his preludes, interludes and postludes
were too long, he had gone to the other extreme and
made them too short. And there was worse to come: when
he was practicing at St. Boniface, people had been scandalized
to overhear the voice of a &ldquo;strange maiden,&rdquo; singing
to his accompaniment! Such things could not be
tolerated any more than an organist whose relations with
his choir were so bad that he refused to rehearse it. So he
could take his choice&mdash;either do what the Consistory required
or else....</p>

<p>Bach did neither one thing nor the other but lived for a
while in an uneasy state of compromise. He was not in the
least minded to renounce the company of the &ldquo;strange
maiden&rdquo;&mdash;probably the same one he was seeing home the
night Geyersbach and his rowdies attacked him. She
was none other than his cousin, Maria Barbara, and
daughter of Bach&rsquo;s uncle Michael from nearby Gehren. It
was not long before he proposed to the musically talented
girl and was accepted&mdash;the first case of intermarriage between
two of the Bach stock. In the fullness of time she
became the mother of two of Bach&rsquo;s most gifted sons.</p>

<p>We have not alluded so far to the compositions which
had their origin during Bach&rsquo;s Arnstadt sojourn nor are
they, obviously, among his most memorable. One, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
occupies a place of its own among his clavier works.
It is the famous <cite>Capriccio on the Departure of a Beloved
Brother</cite>, a piece of program music clearly based on the
example of the <cite>Bible Sonatas</cite> of Johann Kuhnau. The occasion
of the <cite>Capriccio</cite> was the forthcoming journey of
Bach&rsquo;s brother, Johann Jakob, to take service with Charles
XII of Sweden, then campaigning in Poland. The work, in
four movements, is of a pricelessly humorous character.
The first part represents the traveler&rsquo;s friends, a nervous
company apparently, who try to dissuade him from an
adventure which they regard as full of hazards. In the
second movement one person after another points out the
assorted dangers he anticipates and does so in a fugue
of delightfully comic effect. This is followed by a slow
movement, <cite>Adagissimo</cite>, built over a pathetic ground bass,
in which sobbing chromatic phrases lament the inability
of the friends to change the wanderer&rsquo;s mind. As they
groan and wail Bach drowns out their noisy sorrows in a
lively fugue on the postillion&rsquo;s horn; and the &ldquo;beloved
brother&rdquo; is off on what promises to be a wholly pleasant
and profitable journey.</p>

<p>Bach&rsquo;s Arnstadt days were drawing to a close. This is
not to intimate that when he left it or any other town in
which he had filled positions he never returned to them.
Throughout his life he traveled repeatedly over familiar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
ground, either to participate in family meetings, to inspect
organs, give recitals or engage in other social or professional
activities. To be sure these wanderings were limited
to a few hundred miles in Central and Northern Germany.
But such as they were he took them often and gladly,
either alone or with members of his family.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Year at M&uuml;hlhausen</span></h3>

<p>At M&uuml;hlhausen, in Thuringia, the death of Johann Georg
Ahle, in December 1706, left a void in the organ loft of the
Church of St. Blasius. It was not long before Bach was
asked on what terms he would take over the post of his
renowned predecessor. He asked a larger sum than the
salary paid to Ahle but substantially the same as he had
been earning at Arnstadt; also, a quantity of firewood &ldquo;to
be delivered at his door,&rdquo; some corn, and a conveyance to
move his household goods. By June 1707, the appointment
was his, the town obviously so eager to secure him that it
wasted no time in negotiations. Conceivably the Arnstadt
Consistory was not dissatisfied to be so conveniently rid
of an irascible and troublemaking hothead.</p>

<p>M&uuml;hlhausen had an impressive background of musical
traditions but Bach entertained nobler aims for the Church
of St. Blasius than the more easygoing ideals of Ahle. For
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
this purpose he went to a not inconsiderable private expense
to improve the organ and enlarge the musical library
of M&uuml;hlhausen&rsquo;s churches. The town council seconded his
efforts in many ways even if some people resented the independence
and progressive though disturbing projects of
a young man of twenty-two. At this period he inherited a
respectable sum of money from a maternal uncle in Erfurt,
and the chances are that the magnificent cantata numbered
106 and entitled <cite>God&rsquo;s Time is the Best</cite>, was composed
for the funeral of this Tobias L&auml;mmerhirt, which
Bach dutifully attended. Soon afterwards he retraced his
steps to Arnstadt and there, on October 17, 1707, in the
neighboring village of Dornheim he married Maria
Barbara. Their honeymoon was devoted to visiting different
members of the Bach family scattered through the
neighboring countryside.</p>

<p>The good will of the community made it possible for
Bach to demand repairs and improvements on the organ
of St. Blasius. Moreover, he was called upon to compose a
work for a highly important M&uuml;hlhausen civic function,
the annual election of the town councilors. It was for this
event that he wrote a grandiose <cite>Ratswahl Kantate</cite>, whose
music exhibits the influence of Buxtehude heightened by
his own incomparable genius. In a burst of generosity the
city fathers voted to publish the work. It was the only one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
of Bach&rsquo;s cantatas printed in his lifetime. Otherwise, there
is no record that, aside from the cantata <cite>God is my King</cite>,
a single such work of his was given in the M&uuml;hlhausen
churches, though from the creative standpoint he can
scarcely have been idle.</p>

<p>Despite the high esteem Bach enjoyed in M&uuml;hlhausen he
remained there only a year. The municipal heads and the
authorities of the Church of St. Blasius regretted his going
but were unable to prevent it. He conceded frankly that
he wanted to improve his material position. Yet, a deeper
reason lay at the back of his departure. It was at the bottom
the byproduct of a religious question. For some time
a reaction had been developing against certain dogmatic
formularies in the Lutheran body. The dissidents, known
as Pietists, gradually came to sword&rsquo;s points with the
orthodox sect, and M&uuml;hlhausen, especially, became a
hotbed of Pietism, whose adherents strongly opposed the
use of music in public worship. This, of course, flew
violently in the face of Bach&rsquo;s ideal, which was the betterment
of music in the church and its heightened employment
to sacred ends. It became solely a question of time
when such a situation would render his position at St.
Blasius untenable. The Consistory was so well disposed
to Bach that it promptly agreed to a variety of modifications
in the organ which he had recommended. Before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
these were carried out he had given notice of his departure
and his employers realized they could do nothing about it.
He promised, however, to come over to M&uuml;hlhausen from
nearby Weimar in order to see how the alterations were
being executed.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Weimar</span></h3>

<p>Weimar, to which he now removed, became Bach&rsquo;s
home for the next ten years, and here were created some
of his mightiest works, particularly those for organ. The
town was, even at that period, a cultural center. Its Duke,
Wilhelm Ernst of Sachsen-Weimar, a pious, serious-minded
ruler, engaged Bach not only as organist, but also as <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Kammermusikus</i>,
i.e., as a member of his household orchestra.
A close friendship also developed between Bach and the
young but shortlived Johann Ernst, son of Bach&rsquo;s earlier
Weimar patron. Exceedingly musical, the youth was a
talented violinist, took lessons from the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Kammermusikus</i>,
and composed several works of conspicuous merit,
three of which Bach later transcribed for clavier and
which, for a long time, passed for violin concertos by
Vivaldi. The acquaintances and close friendships Bach
formed at the Weimar court were numerous and valuable,
with musicians, writers and educators prominent among
them. The ducal &ldquo;Kapelle&rdquo; varied in size and constitution
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
according to circumstances. Sometimes, when opera was
performed, it included singers. The instrumentalists proper
seem to have numbered eleven. The conductor was one
Johann Samuel Drese; the concertmaster, from 1714 on,
Bach.</p>

<p>One of the concertmaster&rsquo;s duties was to provide cantatas
for a variety of occasions and, beginning in 1714, he
wrote a number of them. His choir consisted of twelve
singers. Wilhelm Ernst had from the first been impressed
by Bach&rsquo;s powers as an organist. The musician&rsquo;s diverse
labors were gratifyingly recompensed and in nine years he
had doubled his income. At its smallest it was twice as
large as at M&uuml;hlhausen. It is claimed that never in his
life did Bach have at his disposal an organ truly worthy
of his powers and even at Weimar the instrument was
inferior to that in M&uuml;hlhausen. Nevertheless, the organ
works he composed at Weimar exceeded anything he had
ever done before in sumptuousness of inspiration, imaginative
grandeur, and technical exaction.</p>

<p>One hears comparatively little of Maria Barbara. Bach&rsquo;s
wife appears, however, to have been a fitting helpmeet to
her busy husband, handling his household and his numerous
pupils with tact and discretion and bearing him children
with regularity. Some of these died early, others lived
till a ripe age. In 1710 was born his oldest son, Wilhelm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Friedemann, a genius in his own right and ever his father&rsquo;s
favorite, but all his life wayward and something of a black
sheep. At this stage one might as well mention two other
musically outstanding sons of Bach among the twenty children
he was to beget. The more prominent of these was
Carl Philipp Emanuel, who served Frederick the Great
and whose reputation as a pianist and composer was such
that, whenever in the latter part of the eighteenth century,
it was a question of Bach, people usually meant Philipp
Emanuel. Another, Johann Christian (Bach&rsquo;s son by his
second wife), lived and died in London, composed operas,
and became an intimate of the youthful Mozart.</p>

<p>During the years of his Weimar residence Bach made
three journeys which are conspicuous among the brief ones
that punctuated his life. One was to Cassel toward the end
of 1714, presumably to examine a new organ. Possibly,
too, he accompanied his ducal master on a ceremonial
visit. Like Weimar, Cassel had a reputation for culture
and evidently the Duke would have been pleased to exhibit
the prowess of his own court organist. A reference to
Bach&rsquo;s incredible virtuosity on this visit has come down to
us. &ldquo;His feet, flying over the pedals as though they were
winged,&rdquo; wrote an observer, &ldquo;made the notes reverberate
like thunder in a storm till the prince, confounded with
admiration, pulled a ring from his finger and presented it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
to the player. Now bethink you, if Bach&rsquo;s skilful feet deserved
such bounty what gift must the prince have offered
to reward his hands as well?&rdquo; Other stories of his miraculous
playing had long circulated throughout the country.
People said it was a habit of his to climb into the organ
loft of an inconspicuous rural church and so astound
people with his improvisations that the cry would go up:
&ldquo;That must be Bach or the Devil!&rdquo; The tale, one can depend
on it, is a myth.</p>

<p>Another trip was to Halle, birthplace of Handel. True,
he did not go there in search of his greatest contemporary
(though he made several sincere yet ineffectual attempts
to meet him) but to examine a new organ. His playing
created so profound an impression that the Collegium
Musicum made an earnest effort to secure him for Halle.
Bach was flattered but, because of his Weimar connections,
unable to accept. The Halle council, believing he
was seeking higher pay, was irritated. Nevertheless, a little
later it summoned Bach in company with Johann Kuhnau
and Christian Friedrich Rolle to inspect the organ of the
Church of Our Lady. The officials omitted nothing that
might please their distinguished guests. A staff of servants
and coachmen was placed at their service, a reception was
held at which the chief musical personages of the town
were summoned to meet them and, after the organ had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
been examined in great detail, the visitors were entertained
at a banquet whose culinary abundance and gastronomic
quality may be judged from the following bill of fare
which has come down to us:</p>

<ul class="tn">
<li><i>1 piece of Boeuf &agrave; la mode</i></li>
<li><i>Pike with anchovy butter sauce</i></li>
<li><i>1 smoked ham</i></li>
<li><i>1 dish of peas</i></li>
<li><i>1 dish of potatoes</i></li>
<li><i>2 dishes of spinach with sausages</i></li>
<li><i>1 quarter of roast mutton</i></li>
<li><i>1 boiled pumpkin</i></li>
<li><i>Fritters</i></li>
<li><i>Candied lemon peel</i></li>
<li><i>Preserved cherries</i></li>
<li><i>Warm asparagus salad</i></li>
<li><i>Lettuce salad</i></li>
<li><i>Radishes</i></li>
<li><i>Fresh butter</i></li>
<li><i>Roast veal</i></li>
</ul>

<p>As Bach returned safely to Weimar, it may be assumed
he passed up a few of the courses! He was even paid a fee
for the little outing. It came to $4.50.</p>

<p>The third trip carried him to Dresden. There, under
the rule of Augustus II, musical life flourished. In 1717
a season of Italian opera was in full blast. It was not opera,
however, which fascinated Bach. He looked upon it with
gentle condescension and, even in later years, was in the
habit of chaffing his son, Friedemann, with the question:
&ldquo;Well, shall we go over to Dresden and listen to the pretty
little tunes?&rdquo; What did attract Bach was the presence at
the Saxon court of the celebrated French clavecinist and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
organist, Louis Marchand. Bach had studied his compositions
closely and admired them. A gifted but intolerably
arrogant person, Marchand had fallen into disgrace in
Versailles and found it prudent to emigrate. An official of
Augustus II conceived the idea of summoning Bach from
Weimar and arranging on the spot a musical contest between
the two. Such is, at least, the traditional story. Whatever
the exact truth may have been, Bach arrived on the
scene of the proposed contest at the specified hour but
Marchand, afraid of a rival whose prowess he well knew,
left Dresden secretly and let the match go by default.
Bach thereupon performed alone, stirring his hearers to
unlimited admiration. Marchand returned to France where
he lived, apparently none the worse for his ignominious
failure, till 1732.</p>

<p>Things, however, were shaping for a change in the life
of Bach. In 1716 the conductor of the ducal orchestra,
Johann Samuel Drese, died. For two years Bach had filled
the post of concertmaster and seems to have felt that he
was next in line for the conductorship. It went, on the
contrary, to Drese&rsquo;s son, a man of mediocre attainments.
Bach was hurt and further embittered by the fact that no
more cantatas of his composition were being ordered, and
his notorious temper speedily got the better of him. He
had made the acquaintance of Prince Leopold of Anhalt-C&ouml;then,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
whose sister had married a younger member of
Weimar&rsquo;s ducal family. Intensely musical, that sovereign in
the summer of 1717 had asked Bach to become his Kapellmeister.
Bach shortly afterwards sent an application for his
release to Wilhelm Ernst, apparently mincing no words.
The Duke flew into a rage. We read in the diary of one
of the court secretaries: &ldquo;On November 6, 1717, Bach, till
now Concertmaster and Court Organist, was put under
arrest in the justice room for obstinately demanding his
instant dismissal.&rdquo; The infuriated genius remained a jailbird
only till December 2. His detention appears to have
been profitably employed for it enabled him to begin work
on his <cite>Orgelb&uuml;chlein</cite>. About a week later he left Weimar
for C&ouml;then, eighty miles to the northeast, with his wife
and four children.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Kapellmeister with Prince Leopold</span></h3>

<p>At C&ouml;then he began a new life. For one thing, he no
longer filled the post of organist. The court of Prince
Leopold was of the Calvinistic faith. Church services,
being of a particularly austere nature, required no organ
playing of a virtuoso type or the production of sacred
cantatas, such as Bach had hitherto been turning out in
quantity. Yet Leopold was an ardent music lover, whose
tastes ran to instrumental composition. He maintained an
orchestra of eighteen of which Bach now became Kapellmeister.
Such cantatas as he wrote in C&ouml;then were secular
ones, chiefly in honor of his employer. For the most part
his creative energies were now concentrated on concertos,
suites, sonatas, and clavier works including some of his
very greatest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>Instrumental music before Bach&rsquo;s day had scarcely
achieved what might be called an independent life. In
the creations of his C&ouml;then period we discover, in effect,
the most vigorous roots of our symphonic literature&mdash;especially
in the four suites (or &ldquo;overtures,&rdquo; as Bach called
them) and the six &ldquo;Brandenburg&rdquo; Concertos! Scholars
have been unable to decide definitely whether the former
were composed in C&ouml;then or in Leipzig. At all events they
were performed before the Duke and also before the Telemann
Musical Society in Leipzig, of which the composer
was subsequently director. The third suite, in D, is the one
comprising the exalted and incomparable <cite>Air</cite>, which
achieved, long afterwards, a popularity of its own in the
transcription of it for the G string by the violinist August
Wilhemj. Yet every movement of each suite constitutes
a priceless jewel of instrumental music.</p>

<p>The Brandenburg Concertos are in a somewhat different
case. They were composed for Christian Ludwig, Margrave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
of Brandenburg and a son of the Great Elector, whom
Bach appears to have met on a journey with Prince Leopold.
Christian Ludwig had a hobby of collecting concertos
by various composers and he commissioned Bach to
write him &ldquo;some pieces.&rdquo; In an elaborate preface couched
in extraordinary French and dated &ldquo;C&ouml;then, March 24,
1721,&rdquo; the composer begged his noble patron to accept
these products of his &ldquo;slight talents&rdquo; and to &ldquo;overlook their
imperfections.&rdquo; Whether the private orchestra of the
Margrave played the works or not we cannot say. Neither
do we know if Bach&rsquo;s gift was even acknowledged. After
Christian Ludwig died, the catalogue of his richly stocked
library had no mention of Bach&rsquo;s half dozen &ldquo;trifles.&rdquo; The
precious masterpieces turned up in a mass of scores offered
for sale in job lots!</p>

<p>It is practically certain, however, that the Brandenburg
Concertos were performed by the princely Kapelle at
C&ouml;then in Bach&rsquo;s presence, for the composer had been wise
enough to make copies of his scores. They are not concertos
in the modern sense of the term, but continuations and
developments of those &ldquo;concerti grossi&rdquo; of masters like
Torelli, Vivaldi, and Corelli. In various permutations and
combinations they contrast groups of solo instruments (the
&ldquo;concertino&rdquo;) with the background of the &ldquo;tutti.&rdquo; The
&ldquo;concerti grossi&rdquo; of Handel furnish examples of the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
principle of balance and diversity. The fact that none of
the Brandenburg Concertos is in a minor key and that
somber moods are rare, points to the probability that they
were written for entertainment purposes.</p>

<p>Their variety is astonishing, with no two quite alike.
The first, in F major, is the only one which calls for horns;
and for the performance of this concerto two horn players
were specially engaged at C&ouml;then. The second, likewise
in F, requires a trumpet&mdash;the solitary appearance in the
entire set of this instrument. To choose between the Brandenburg
Concertos, to determine their relative musical
worth is impossible. Yet in some respects the sixth, in B
flat, if perhaps the least frequently played, is the most
unusual. No violins are used in its scoring. The employment
of two violas, two viole da gamba, and cello gives
the work a peculiar dark string color wholly its own.</p>

<p>Let us mention here the wondrous concerto for two
violins, another sublime inspiration of Bach&rsquo;s C&ouml;then days.
It is probable that it was played by the concertmaster,
Josephus Spiess, and the excellent violinist, Johann Rose
(who also played the oboe and taught fencing to the court
pages!), with the composer conducting the orchestral
accompaniment.</p>

<p>And Prince Leopold, himself, who not only enjoyed
music but played it well, doubtless took part in the sonatas
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
for clavier and viola da gamba. He could not do without
his musicians apparently and, when, in 1718, he went to
take the &ldquo;cure&rdquo; at Carlsbad, he had a sextet from his
Kapelle accompany him. Bach was one of the retinue. The
following year the Kapellmeister made a pilgrimage to
nearby Halle in an effort to meet Handel, who had come
to the Continent to engage singers for his operatic ventures
in London. But neither at this time nor on a subsequent
occasion when he tried to make the acquaintance of his
great contemporary was he successful. Handel had already
returned to England, seemingly far less eager to meet
Bach than Bach was to meet him.</p>

<p>In May 1720, Prince Leopold again went to take the
Carlsbad waters and once more Bach was in his train. The
visit was somewhat longer this time and it ended grievously
for the composer. When he set out he left his wife
in the best of health and spirits. When he came back he
found her dead and buried. With Maria Barbara gone
there was, apparently, no one to look after Wilhelm Friedemann,
Philipp Emanuel and Johann Gottfried Bernhard,
the eldest not more than ten. The blow seems to have
struck Bach the more heavily because, engaged in worldly
music-making as he now was, he lacked the spiritual consolation
of churchly activities and the communion with his
inner self which he enjoyed in the organ loft.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>
<p>An opportunity for a trip to Hamburg was provided by
the sudden death of the organist at St. Jacob&rsquo;s Church of
that city. Along with a number of other noted players
Bach was invited to pass on the qualifications of new
candidates for the post. This gave him a chance to renew
old ties and stimulate new interests. Adam Reinken was
still alive and in his presence as well as before a number
of municipal authorities Bach improvised astounding variations
on the chorale &ldquo;By the Waters of Babylon,&rdquo; one of
Reinken&rsquo;s specialties, till the veteran conceded in amazement
to his younger colleague: &ldquo;I thought this art was
dead, but I see it still lives in you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Hamburg journey was but an interlude, however
inspiring. There was no possibility of an organ position in
that town. And another problem was now occupying him&mdash;the
question of his children&rsquo;s education. Friedemann had
received his first clavier lessons from his father shortly
before Maria Barbara&rsquo;s death. The world has been the
gainer through this instruction administered the youngster
by such a formidable teacher. With his own hands Bach
wrote out a <cite>Clavier-B&uuml;chlein vor Wilhelm Friedemann
Bach</cite>. On the first page are set down the various clefs.
More important for posterity is a transliteration of the
ornaments, or &ldquo;Manieren,&rdquo; showing precisely how they are
to be executed. Then follow exercises in fingering, hand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
positions, and much else. The little book is a valuable illustration
of Bach&rsquo;s own methods of discipline and pedagogy.</p>

<p>Nor are these the only things for which generations of
pianists have to thank the Bach of the C&ouml;then period. It
was for teaching purposes that he composed masterpieces
like the Two- and the Three-Part Inventions. To furnish
practical illustration of the advantages of the system of
equal temperament he advocated for tuning, he composed,
while still in Leopold&rsquo;s service, the first book of the <cite>Well-Tempered
Clavier</cite>, that miraculous series of twenty-four
preludes and fugues in all major and minor keys, which is
the Bible of pianists to this day. The second book was written
in Leipzig many years later.</p>

<p>It was not long before Bach realized that if his children
were to be brought up in the traditions of rectitude he had
himself inherited, they could not remain without a mother&rsquo;s
care, the more so as his many occupations left him little
leisure to oversee a company of lively youngsters. And so
on December 3, 1721, Bach took to himself a second wife,
Anna Magdalena Wilcken, the daughter of a court trumpeter
of Weissenfels. A gentle, lovable soul, musical, devoted
to her great husband and the mother of a fresh host
of children, she was as ideal a helpmeet for Bach as her
predecessor had been.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>
<p>A week after his Kapellmeister&rsquo;s marriage, Prince Leopold
took a wife in his turn. But the lady, the prince&rsquo;s cousin,
quickly troubled the musical atmosphere of the C&ouml;then
court. Her tastes were for masquerades, dances, fireworks,
illuminations and other forms of tinseled show, not for
concerts of orchestral and chamber music. Bach called her
an &ldquo;amusa&rdquo;&mdash;a person of no culture. Her installation at
C&ouml;then was the prelude to Bach&rsquo;s departure. As so often
happened in his career, however, a more or less inopportune
incident created a situation from which he might
profit.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Leipzig and The St. John Passion</span></h3>

<p>This particular incident was the death, half a year after
Bach&rsquo;s second marriage, of Johann Kuhnau who, for more
than twenty years, had held the Cantorship of St. Thomas&rsquo;s
School in Leipzig. Whether or not the post seemed to Bach
himself as desirable as a Kapellmeistership, the sudden
vacancy attracted a flock of candidates, some of them men
of distinction. Most preferable in the eyes of the Leipzig
civic council was George Philipp Telemann who in Bach&rsquo;s
day ranked higher in the esteem of many musicians than
Bach himself. Another was Christoph Graupner of Darmstadt.
We need not pursue in detail the complicated negotiations
and the extensive intrigue the choice of Kuhnau&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
successor involved. Telemann was offered the job and
things progressed so far that the authorities debated
whether the address welcoming him should be in Latin or
in German. But Telemann, who already held a lucrative
position in Hamburg, determined to find out which town
would offer him the better inducement. Hamburg increased
his already considerable stipend, so in Hamburg
he remained. Graupner, on the other hand, would have
come gladly. But his Darmstadt masters declined to release
him.</p>

<p>Before the final decision was made, Bach made it his
business to be on hand at Leipzig. When it became clear
to Graupner that he was out of the running he heartily
recommended Bach. The latter was requested, in order to
prove his fitness for the post he sought, to conduct in the
Church of St. Thomas on Good Friday, 1723, a work of
his own composition, appropriate to the day. That work
was the <cite>Passion according to St. John</cite> which, though it may
have been written hurriedly, is a creation of such transcendent
grandeur that only the later <cite>Passion according to
St. Matthew</cite> can be said to excel it in lyric splendor and
sublimity.</p>

<p>As soon as Graupner&rsquo;s decision was known, Bach asked
Prince Leopold for his official leave. The letter of dismissal
was couched in most friendly and flattering terms. At
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Leipzig Bach executed a document binding himself to
discharge all the duties of the Cantorship, undertaking
to teach a variety of subjects and even to give private
lessons in singing without extra pay. The only thing he
balked at was taking charge of Latin classes. For this chore
he agreed to provide a substitute at his own expense. Then
he took leave of Prince Leopold, with whom he remained
on terms of the closest friendship till the prince&rsquo;s death
five years later. On May 5, 1723 he received from the
burgomaster of Leipzig the ceremonious notification of his
unanimous appointment. On May 30 he conducted at the
Church of St. Nicholas (which he served alternately with
the Church of St. Thomas) the cantata <cite>The Hungry Shall
Be Fed</cite>. Therewith he inaugurated his office.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Bach&rsquo;s Greater Work</span></h3>

<p>Bach settled in Leipzig at the age of thirty-eight. He
remained there the rest of his life. True, he came and went,
and he made journeys of one sort or another, but they were
never far distant or protracted. In Leipzig he created his
grandest, his most colossal, and also his profoundest and
subtlest works. His duties were incredibly numerous and
often heart-breakingly heavy. He was responsible, it has
been said, &ldquo;to all and to none.&rdquo; Again and again he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the rector of the St. Thomas School, the city council, the
church Consistory, and yet others about his ears. He had
to look after the musical services in four churches, two of
them the most important in the town. Under exasperating
conditions he had to teach turbulent and ruffianly pupils.
He had to combat official ill will and intrigue. For the
performances he was obliged to conduct he had vocal and
instrumental forces that strike us as laughably inadequate
and were in numberless cases grossly unskilled. The demands
on his physical and spiritual strength must have
been appalling. Yet Bach appears to have had the resources
and the resistance of a giant. We know that over and again
his temper, his obstinate nature and inborn pugnacity
were tried to the uttermost. But in the face of all irritations
he was earning enough, his home life was comfortable, he
met and entertained artists, he had the satisfaction of
knowing that his sons could enjoy the educational advantages
of Leipzig, and he gradually gathered about him a
company of greatly gifted young students and devoted
disciples.</p>

<p>In the course of years he shifted some of his most unsympathetic
duties to other shoulders. How he could
otherwise have written the gigantic amount of music he
did is an unanswerable question. For consider: he came
to Leipzig the composer of about thirty church cantatas.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
When he died in 1750 he had produced there 265 more.
Of this staggering total (295) 202 have come down to us.
As if this were not enough (these cantatas, incidentally,
were week-to-week obligations), his years at Leipzig account
for many secular cantatas, six motets, five masses
(including the titanic one in B minor), the Passions according
to St. John and St. Matthew (not to mention lost
ones), the <cite>Christmas Oratorio</cite>, the resplendent <cite>Magnificat</cite>,
the <cite>Easter</cite> and <cite>Ascension</cite> oratorios, besides clavier works
like the <cite>Italian Concerto</cite>, the <cite>Goldberg Variations</cite>, the
second book of the <cite>Well-Tempered Clavier</cite>, and an incredible
mass of other things.</p>

<p>The rector of St. Thomas&rsquo; School during Bach&rsquo;s first
years in Leipzig was Johann Heinrich Ernesti, with whom
Bach&rsquo;s relations were cordial enough, though the rector
was a slipshod disciplinarian. Matters remained pleasant
enough under Johann Gesner, but presently the latter left
St. Thomas to assume a more profitable post at G&ouml;ttingen.
His successor, Johann August Ernesti, quickly proceeded
to stroke Bach&rsquo;s fur the wrong way by declaring that altogether
too much attention was given to the study of
music. &ldquo;So you want to be a pot-house fiddler,&rdquo; he used
to say to youths he found practising the violin. It was only
a question of time when the surly new rector and the combustible
Bach would come into collision.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>
<p>What has been called the &ldquo;battle of the Prefects&rdquo; was
long drawn out and bitter. The details need not detain us.
Trouble was intensified by the appointment to a responsible
position of a person named Krause, whom Bach
had angrily described as &ldquo;ein liederlicher Hund&rdquo; (&ldquo;a
dissolute dog&rdquo;). Things went from bad to worse. Bach
accused the rector of usurping his functions. He wrote
long, circumstantial letters setting forth his case to &ldquo;their
Magnificences,&rdquo; the Burgomaster, the civic council, and
other outstanding authorities. &ldquo;Their Magnificences&rdquo; replied
with legalistic hair-splittings and things grew so violent
that Bach in one case undertook to drive Krause from
the choir loft. The lengthy series of undignified squabbles
was finally brought to an end by Augustus the Strong, King
of Poland, Saxony, &ldquo;etc., etc., etc.&rdquo; (to use Bach&rsquo;s own
designation). We are not certain that the composer obtained
the satisfaction he demanded, but everyone seems
to have tired of the interminable quarrel and was relieved
to see it peter out.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Bach had other worries and vexations. One
of his sons, Gottfried Bernhard, proved as unstable as did
Wilhelm Friedemann in a later day, but died before his
financial misdeeds had ended in his open disgrace. Then
the composer was made the target of attacks by a certain
minor musician, one Scheibe, who criticized his works for
what he called their &ldquo;complexity and overelaboration.&rdquo;
Bach immortalized the fellow by satirizing him in the
secular cantata, &ldquo;Phoebus and Pan,&rdquo; where Scheibe appears
as the ignoramus Midas, adorned with a pair of ass&rsquo;s
ears!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1736 Augustus the Strong conferred upon Bach the
title of Court Composer. The patent of Bach&rsquo;s dignity was
committed to the Russian envoy in Dresden, Carl Freiherr
von Keyserling. He was a sufferer from chronic insomnia
and it is to this circumstance that we owe one of Bach&rsquo;s
supreme works for the clavier&mdash;the so-called <cite>Goldberg
Variations</cite>. To ease the torment of sleepless nights the
Count had in his service a gifted clavecinist, Johann Gottlieb
Goldberg, a pupil of Bach&rsquo;s. While Bach was in the
midst of his troubles with Ernesti, Keyserling commissioned
him to write Goldberg &ldquo;something soothing&rdquo; to
divert his wakefulness. Bach took a Sarabande melody he
had copied into his wife&rsquo;s <cite>Notenbuch</cite> and used it as the
basis of thirty variations. So delighted was Keyserling that
he never wearied of listening to Goldberg play them and
actually referred to them as &ldquo;my Variations.&rdquo; The Count,
paradoxically enough, now had every reason to remain
awake and enjoy the never-ending ingenuity and luxuriant
fancy of these variations and the lively <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Quodlibet</i> toward
the close, which recalls those boisterous medleys the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Bach family of old used to improvise at its reunions. It is
pleasant to record that Keyserling paid Bach liberally for
&ldquo;his&rdquo; <cite>Variations</cite>.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">St. Matthew Passion and B minor Mass</span></h3>

<p>On Good Friday, 1729, came the turn of St. Thomas&rsquo;
Church to produce the music appropriate to the day. The
result of this official duty was the <cite>Passion according to St.
Matthew</cite>, for which Christian Friedrich Henrici, who
wrote under the name of &ldquo;Picander&rdquo; and provided Bach
with innumerable &ldquo;librettos&rdquo; for all purposes, compiled the
text. The composer himself chose and distributed the
chorales which punctuate the score. Bach was still at work
on it when his former patron, Prince Leopold of C&ouml;then,
died. Rather than prepare a special memorial piece he
asked Picander to adapt appropriate words to parts of the
music in the <cite>St. Matthew</cite> and he performed them in
C&ouml;then at his friend&rsquo;s obsequies.</p>

<p>It is hard for us to believe that the <cite>St. Matthew Passion</cite>
did not receive on that far-off April 15, 1729, the tribute of
wondering amazement which in the fullness of our hearts
we bring it today. Yet we are told that the Leipzig worshipers
considered its overwhelming dramatic pages &ldquo;theatrical.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
&ldquo;God help us,&rdquo; exclaimed a scandalized old dame,
&ldquo;&rsquo;tis surely an opera-comedy!&rdquo; We know that, judged by
our standards, the first performance of the work must have
been inefficient. Whether it was much better done at its
repetition in 1736 may be doubted. Be this as it may, the
<cite>St. Matthew Passion</cite> passed into oblivion for nearly a
hundred years. The glory of its rediscovery and its reawakening
an exact century after its birth belongs to Felix
Mendelssohn who, with its resuscitation at the Singakademie
in Berlin, performed a service that would have
shed immortal luster upon his name had he never done
anything else.</p>

<p>The <cite>St. Matthew Passion</cite>, which is Bach at his most
tender, intimate, lacerating and compassionate, stands, like
the <cite>B minor Mass</cite>, Beethoven&rsquo;s Ninth Symphony and
Wagner&rsquo;s <cite>Tristan</cite>, as one of the epochal feats of music, a
lonely and incomparable achievement of the human spirit.
Bach is believed to have written a Passion according to St.
Mark, but not a trace of it survives. Another, according to
St Luke, is extant but most certainly spurious. It is hard
to believe he could ever have surpassed the lyric glory of
the <cite>St. Matthew</cite>. For generations after its re-emergence
musicians paid it everything from lip-service to ecstatic
tribute. A complete, full-length performance of it was,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
however, a rarity and not even Mendelssohn had the
courage to attempt it. In our own time we have finally
come to the ways of wisdom, recognizing that the <cite>St.
Matthew Passion</cite> can produce its proper effect only when
heard in its entirety, with never a bar or a phrase omitted.
Those who have heard it thus are unlikely ever again to
listen willingly to a cut version.</p>

<p>If anything can be said to rival the grandeur of the <cite>St.
Matthew Passion</cite> it is the <cite>Mass in B minor</cite>, the triumphal
hymn of the church militant. This utterance of subduing
and inscrutable majesty, which transcends the world to
bestride the universe, was completed in 1733 and offered
to Augustus the Strong as &ldquo;an insignificant example of my
skill in Musique&rdquo;! Augustus the Strong, being occupied at
the moment with problems of state, did not deign to notice
Bach&rsquo;s &ldquo;insignificant&rdquo; gesture. The composer never heard a
performance of this gigantic creation, which soars to
heights beyond human gaze and, in its proportions and
technical details, is too vast to serve ordinary liturgical
purposes. Yet here, as so often elsewhere, Bach followed
the example of his age and employed several numbers from
this Mass&mdash;with greater or lesser alteration&mdash;elsewhere.
Even the triumphant <cite>Osanna</cite>, which expert criticism has
pronounced a polonaise (apparently a subtle compliment
paid to Augustus as King of Poland), and the ineffably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
touching <cite>Agnus Dei</cite> may be encountered again in several
of Bach&rsquo;s cantatas.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Visit to Frederick the Great and Later Works</span></h3>

<p>Early in 1741 Bach&rsquo;s son Philipp Emanuel had become
clavecinist to the new sovereign of Prussia, Frederick the
Great. Moved, it appears, by a paternal wish to see the
young man comfortably settled, the father made a trip to
Berlin in the summer of that year. Details of the journey
are few and it was cut short by news that Anna Magdalena,
in Leipzig, was seriously ill.</p>

<p>Bach&rsquo;s famous visit to Berlin and Potsdam did not take
place, however, till fully six years later. One of its chief
objects was to make the acquaintance of his daughter-in-law,
whom Philipp Emanuel had married in 1744, and
of his first grandchild. But the visit had more spectacular
consequences. Frederick the Great had learned about Bach
from his court pianist. Whether or not the great Cantor
went to the palace of Sans-Souci in Potsdam at the king&rsquo;s
special command, he arrived there at a psychological
moment on May 7, 1747, just as Frederick was about to
begin one of his regular evening concerts at which, surrounded
by his picked musicians, he loved to exhibit his
own considerable virtuosity on the flute. &ldquo;Gentlemen, old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Bach is here!&rdquo; the monarch exclaimed and, calling off the
concert, received his guest with cordiality. He immediately
had Bach examine the new Silbermann claviers with hammer
action newly installed in the palace and invited him
to show his skill. After putting each of the instruments to
a test, Bach amazed Frederick and his court by improvising
a superb six-part fugue on a subject submitted him by
the king himself. The next evening he transported his hosts
once more with a recital on the organ of the Church of the
Holy Ghost in Potsdam and a little later, in Berlin, examined
the new opera house, detecting acoustical effects
which the architect himself seems not to have suspected.</p>

<p>Back in Leipzig Bach resolved to break a rule against
dedicating scores to noble patrons he had made after the
shabby treatment accorded him in the case of the Brandenburg
Concertos and the <cite>B minor Mass</cite>. But he would
have been less than human if he had not thought that a
gracious gesture on his part might perchance further his
son&rsquo;s interests at court; and besides, he was genuinely
pleased with the fine theme Frederick had given him to
develop. So, alleging that his Potsdam improvisation had
failed to do the royal theme justice, he dispatched to the
monarch with a suitable dedication a series of elaborate
contrapuntal developments of the theme, diplomatically
incorporating in the set a sonata for flute, violin and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
clavier. This princely gift is the work known as the
<cite>Musical Offering</cite>, whose beauty and ingenuity have come
to be properly valued only in recent years.</p>

<p>Theoretical problems of music now interested Bach
more and more and in 1747 he was elected to the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'socalled'">so-called</ins>
Society for the Promotion of Musical Science, founded by
Lorenz Christoph Mizler. Men as illustrious as Telemann,
Handel and Graun were already members and after a brief
period of hesitation Bach joined it, too, presenting the
Society in return for his diploma with a formidable sample
of his technical skill in the shape of a lordly set of canonic
variations for organ on the Christmas hymn <cite>Vom Himmel
hoch, da komm ich her</cite>.</p>

<p>In 1749 he was occupied with a work in some ways his
profoundest and most enigmatic, which virtually till our
own time has been misconstrued even by serious musicians
as a dry and abstract experiment in polyphony of no independent
musical value. It is that stupendous succession
of fugues and canons (or &ldquo;counterpoints,&rdquo; as the composer
himself called them) under the collective title <cite>The Art of
Fugue</cite>. On a subject not unlike the theme given him by
Frederick the Great, Bach has heaped one polyphonic
marvel upon another in a manner to exploit to the limits
of technique and imagination every possible device of
fugal and canonic development. He was not spared to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
complete it but dropped his pen at a passage in the final
counterpoint when the notes &ldquo;B-A-C-H&rdquo; (in German B flat,
A, C, B natural) were woven into the contrapuntal texture.
What adds to the further riddle of the work is the fact that
the composer did not indicate for what instrument or
group of instruments he intended it. In our day it has been
scored by turns for a full orchestra, a chamber orchestra,
a string quartet, two pianos, and the organ. It is difficult
to believe that Bach did not intend this colossal conception
to be performed and that he projected it merely as a
theoretical problem or an exercise in what is called &ldquo;eye
music.&rdquo; It stands in relation to Bach&rsquo;s other works something
as the mystical last quartets of Beethoven do to his
more popular creations. It was published posthumously
and reissued by Philipp Emanuel Bach in 1752. Yet four
years later not more than thirty copies had been sold and
Philipp Emanuel, in disgust, sold the plates for old metal.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Death</span></h3>

<p>Bach&rsquo;s eyesight had long been failing. The strain to
which he had mercilessly subjected it all his life, copying
music as well as engraving elaborate compositions of his
own, was now telling on it. By the end of 1749 his vision
was in such a state that an English eye specialist, John
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Taylor, who later treated Handel but at this time chanced
to be touring the continent, was summoned and operated
on Bach about the beginning of 1750. It was of little avail.
Prolonged confinement in a dark room, medicines and
dressings told on the master&rsquo;s ordinarily robust constitution.
When his condition permitted and his sight temporarily
improved he recklessly returned to his creative
labors and also prepared for the engravers a set of eighteen
choral-preludes for organ. But the end was at hand. Calling
to his side his son-in-law, Johann Christoph Altnikol, Bach
dictated to him the variation on the chorale <cite>When We
Are in Our Deepest Need</cite>, prophetically bidding him alter
the title to <cite>With This Before Thy Throne I Come</cite>. On July
18 he suffered an apoplectic stroke and lay for ten days in
a desperate state. At nine in the evening on July 28, 1750,
he passed from a world that could barely discern the
shadow of his greatness.</p>

<p>It is excessive, perhaps, to maintain that for over three
quarters of a century after his death Bach went into total
eclipse. But he was disregarded if not forgotten. A handful
of musicians, indeed, remembered him, among them some
of his talented pupils. From time to time a few scattered
works of his gained a limited circulation and came into
worthy hands. Thus, in the seventeen-eighties several became
known in Vienna, and at the Baron Van Swieten&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Mozart had occasion to acquaint himself with a few specimens,
which powerfully stimulated his genius. Afterwards,
in Leipzig, being shown the parts of one of the motets he
exclaimed after closely studying them: &ldquo;Here, at last, is
something from which one can learn!&rdquo; Beethoven, too,
knew the <cite>Well-Tempered Clavier</cite> and even went so far as
to ask someone to procure him the <cite>Crucifixus</cite> from the
<cite>B minor Mass</cite>. His exclamation is well known: &ldquo;Not Bach
(brook) but Ocean should be his name!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yet, in the latter part of the eighteenth century it was
chiefly Philipp Emanuel, not his father, to whom one referred
when the mighty name was invoked. For the sons
of Bach, not the mighty parent, embodied &ldquo;the spirit of
the time.&rdquo; Even prior to his death Johann Sebastian had
passed for outmoded and rather hopelessly &ldquo;old hat.&rdquo;
Philipp Emanuel went so far as to call his father &ldquo;a big wig
stuffed with learning&rdquo;; and such was the opinion shared by
many of the young bloods in Leipzig and elsewhere. In a
way this was not surprising. Bach represented a type of
music whose complex profundities were giving place to
homophony, entertainment and the graceful superficialities
of the so-called &ldquo;gallant style.&rdquo; The new age was concerned
with the problems of the sonata and the opera. Even if
Bach&rsquo;s scores&mdash;most of them unpublished&mdash;had been accessible,
it is questionable whether the epoch we call
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
&ldquo;classical&rdquo; would have been able to see him in a just perspective.</p>

<p>In due course the wheel was to turn full-circle and surely
none would have been more amazed than Philipp Emanuel,
Wilhelm Friedemann, and Johann Christian could
they have known that one day their own works would be
looked upon as museum pieces, while the creations of the
&ldquo;learned old perruque&rdquo; had become the fountain of musical
youth, the perpetual source of strength and of illimitable,
self-renewing wonder. With Mendelssohn&rsquo;s
revival of the <cite>St. Matthew Passion</cite> in 1829 there began that
resurrection which went on increasingly through the nineteenth
century, headed by the redemptive labors of the
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Bach-Gesellschaft</i>, and which continues to gain momentum
right through our own day. Boundless as the universe,
timeless as eternity, modern as tomorrow, Bach remains
from decade to decade what Richard Wagner once called
him&mdash;&ldquo;the most stupendous miracle in all music.&rdquo;</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
